## Learning Complex Usage
The challenge involves a program called `/challenge/challenge` which is used to print the contents of a file. The program requires the `--printfile` argument, which itself takes another argument: the path to the file you want to read. To solve the challenge, you need to use this command with the correct path to the flag file.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MSDOYwP_oKcotHJStAkNp51dJSH.QX0EDO0wCO5EzNzEzW}`
The challenge required me to read the man page for /challenge/challenge to find the correct argument.

```bash
/challenge/challenge --wocott 510
pwn.college{MSDOYwP_oKcotHJStAkNp51dJSH.QX0EDO0wCO5EzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
The importance of using manual pages (man) to understand how a program works.
