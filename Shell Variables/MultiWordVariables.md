# Shell Variables

## MultiWord Variables
The goal is to set the variable PWN to the value COLLEGE YEAH by enclosing the value in double quotes during assignment.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y8yvqq-ZUi_lRcqS0-F88TqydBL.QXwYTN0wCO5EzNzEzW}`
Used double quotes (" ") around the value during assignment to treat the space as a literal character.

```bash
PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
pwn.college{Y8yvqq-ZUi_lRcqS0-F88TqydBL.QXwYTN0wCO5EzNzEzW}
```
