# Shell Variables

## Printing Variables
The goal is to use the echo command to print the contents of this variable to the terminal.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QY3s8dkI5aE-WTtOfeq9PlkPt8s.QX3UTN0wCO5EzNzEzW}`
I solved this by using the echo command followed by the variable name prefixed with a dollar sign ($). 

```bash
echo $FLAG
```

### New Learnings
Variable substitution, Where prepending a variable name with a dollar sign ($) tells the shell to replace the variable's name with its stored value. 
Echo Command is used to display this.
