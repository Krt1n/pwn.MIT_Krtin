# Hello Hackers

## Introduction to arguements
Let's try something more complicated: a command with arguments, which is what we call additional data passed to the command. When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MqPgld2Ax3mfwEIBtBjJHDlM096.QX4YjM1wCO5EzNzEzW}`

Very Straight forward Question, We just had to type the command and arguement in a single line

```bash
~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MqPgld2Ax3mfwEIBtBjJHDlM096.QX4YjM1wCO5EzNzEzW}
```
