# Commands

## touching files
Of course, you can also create files! There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here. You can create a new, blank file by touching it with the touch command

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UDkVrDV6EDHwLc5c5NKpATzflNE.QXwMDO0wCO5EzNzEzW}`
We have to use touch command to create two files named pwn and college and then just run /challenge/run cmd

```bash
:~$ cd /tmp
:/tmp$ touch pwn
:/tmp$ touch college
:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UDkVrDV6EDHwLc5c5NKpATzflNE.QXwMDO0wCO5EzNzEzW}
```
