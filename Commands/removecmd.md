# Commands

## removing files
Files are all around you. Like candy wrappers, there'll eventually be too many of them. In this level, we'll learn to clean up!
In Linux, you remove files with the rm command.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IyMjyCrN-QuS0qpgeATeqv1svx1.QX2kDM1wCO5EzNzEzW}`
We have removed the file to get the flag.

```bash
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls
delete_me  f
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{IyMjyCrN-QuS0qpgeATeqv1svx1.QX2kDM1wCO5EzNzEzW}
```
