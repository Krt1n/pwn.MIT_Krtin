# Commands

## more catting practice


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4JNx-UZ2dLTH8vqSGSvFFlEqxZJ.QXwITO0wCO5EzNzEzW}`

The file is located in the flag directory, so we just use the command to 
```bash
~$ cat /usr/share/bug/flag
pwn.college{4JNx-UZ2dLTH8vqSGSvFFlEqxZJ.QXwITO0wCO5EzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
cat is used for reading out files, if mulitple files are provided it concats both the files.
/flag is where the flag always lives in pwn.college.
We can absoulte path to access a file while applying cat.
