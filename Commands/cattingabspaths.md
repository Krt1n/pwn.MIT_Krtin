# Commands

## catting absolute paths
In this directory, I will not copy it to your home directory, but I will make it readable. You can read it with cat at its absolute path: /flag.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IuijU_ZWjeRB_dLC4toL1TAe3CM.QX5ETO0wCO5EzNzEzW}`

The file is located in the flag directory, so we just use the command to 
```bash
cat /flag
pwn.college{IuijU_ZWjeRB_dLC4toL1TAe3CM.QX5ETO0wCO5EzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
cat is used for reading out files, if mulitple files are provided it concats both the files.
/flag is where the flag always lives in pwn.college.
