# Commands

## moving files
ou can also move files around with the mv command.This challenge wants you to move the /flag file into /tmp/hack-the-planet (do it)! When you're done, run /challenge/check, which will check things out and give the flag to you.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IkL2Tg5P3tl5V40aQPHzrRYtIc5.0VOxEzNxwCO5EzNzEzW}`
We have moved the file to get the flag.

```bash
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet
Correct! Performing 'mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet'.
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ /challenge/check
Congrats! You successfully moved the flag to /tmp/hack-the-planet! Here it is:
pwn.college{IkL2Tg5P3tl5V40aQPHzrRYtIc5.0VOxEzNxwCO5EzNzEzW}
```
