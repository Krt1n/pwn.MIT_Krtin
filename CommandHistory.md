# Hello Hackers

## Command History
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cb_QnUrWs8KMZzyfm1ejt87Ymcw.0lNzEzNxwCO5EzNzEzW}`

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for any bash commands and output you type on the terminal.

```bash
~$ the flag is pwn.college{cb_QnUrWs8KMZzyfm1ejt87Ymcw.0lNzEzNxwCO5EzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Arrow keys are used to go to previous commands in linux CLI.
